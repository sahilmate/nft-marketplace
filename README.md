# NFT Marketplace

</div>

This repository contains a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace website.
This website is primarily constructed using **HTML** and **CSS** for the structure and styling, respectively.
**JavaScript** is utilized minimally to enhance the functionality and provide dynamic behavior.


# 😎 Files

1. **[index.html](https://github.com/sahilmate/nft-marketplace/blob/main/index.html)**

   The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, including the header, main sections, and script imports.

2. **[style.css](https://github.com/sahilmate/nft-marketplace/blob/main/style.css)**

   The CSS file provides styling for the entire web page, including the navigation bar, hero section, card items, and about section.

3. **[script.js](https://github.com/sahilmate/nft-marketplace/blob/main/script.js)**

   The JavaScript file handles the dynamic behavior of the web page. It includes functionality to toggle the "active" class when a "btn-heart" (like) button is clicked.
